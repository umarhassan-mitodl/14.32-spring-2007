description: 'U. S. Mergers from 1919 to 1979. From 1919 to 1979, there were peaks
  and troughs in the number U. S. mergers. A sine wave with constants that have economic
  significance was fitted to the data. The figure shows that although there is a general
  wavelike trend in the actual data, the art of econometrics is necessary to create
  the simplicity and smoothness of the fitted equation. (Image by MIT OCW. Adapted
